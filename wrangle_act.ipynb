    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, with documenting my wrangling efforts, I will also showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because [\"they're good dogs Brent.\"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage."

    "1. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive: This file was given by Udacity directly in the downloadable format through this [link](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)\n",

The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network.This file `image_predictions.tsv` is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the **Requests** library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, we will query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's **Tweepy** library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called `tweet_json.txt file`. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then we will read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count."
